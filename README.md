# Synapse - Your Digital Music & Memory Platform

**Synapse** is a modern web application designed to beautifully intertwine your music listening experience with your personal memories. It allows you to manage your music library, create playlists, enjoy an immersive playback experience with visualizations, and uniquely, associate personal memories (notes, photos, moods) with your favorite tracks.

**Rediscover your memories through the power of music.**

   *Application: DEMO*

## üé∂ How It Works

Synapse offers a seamless flow to connect your music and memories:

1.  **üéµ Populate Your Library:** Upload your personal audio files (MP3, WAV, FLAC, etc.). Synapse automatically attempts to extract metadata like title, artist, and album art. You can also play local files directly without uploading.
2.  **üß† Create Rich Memories:** For any track in your library, create detailed memories. Add a title, date, location, people involved, your mood, the activity you were doing, personal notes, and even a photo to capture the moment.
3.  **üéß Listen & Relive:** As you listen to your music using the built-in player, you can easily access and view the memories associated with the current track. The immersive player with dynamic visualizations enhances this experience.
4.  **üéº Organize & Discover:** Create custom playlists to curate your music for different moods or occasions. Explore your memories through a dedicated timeline, and (with future AI integration) get personalized recommendations based on your listening habits and memory associations.
5.  **üé® Customize Your Vibe:** Tailor the entire application's look and feel with an extensive theming system, including pre-defined themes and a custom color creator.

Under the hood, Synapse uses **Supabase** for secure backend services (database, authentication, storage) and **React** with **Tailwind CSS** and **Framer Motion** for a responsive, modern, and animated user interface.


## ‚ú® Why Synapse? The Synapse Advantage

In a world –º—É–∑—ã–∫–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã—Ö —Å—Ç—Ä–∏–º–∏–Ω–≥–æ–≤—ã—Ö —Å–µ—Ä–≤–∏—Å–æ–≤ (music streaming services), Synapse offers a uniquely personal and introspective approach to your music collection:

*   **üîó Deeper Connection to Your Music:**
    Go beyond passive listening. Synapse helps you actively engage with your music by linking it to the moments and emotions that define your life. It transforms your music library into a rich, personal archive.

*   **üí° Rediscover Forgotten Moments:**
    How often do you hear a song and get a fleeting feeling of a past memory? Synapse makes these connections tangible, allowing you to easily recall and cherish those specific experiences tied to your favorite tunes.

*   **üñºÔ∏è A Multimedia Musical Journal:**
    With the ability to add notes, photos, locations, and moods, Synapse becomes more than just a music player; it's an interactive, multimedia journal where music is the soundtrack to your memories.

*   **üöÄ Modern & Immersive Experience:**
    Enjoy a beautifully designed, theme-aware interface with smooth animations and dynamic music visualizations that make listening more engaging.

*   **üîí Privacy & Control:**
    You decide what's public and what's private. Keep your sensitive memories linked to tracks for your eyes only, or share curated playlists and public tracks with others.

*   **üõ†Ô∏è Powerful Organization Tools:**
    Manage your uploaded music and local files, create unlimited playlists, and easily edit track metadata. Synapse provides the tools you need to keep your collection organized.

*   **üîÆ Future-Ready with AI (Potential):**
    The groundwork is laid for AI-powered features, promising even smarter memory suggestions, playlist generations, and deeper insights into your musical journey.

**Synapse isn't just about playing music; it's about experiencing the story *behind* your music.**

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (LTS version recommended)
*   Bun (Package manager used in this project)
*   A Supabase account and project.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Quiflern/Synapse
    cd Synapse
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies using Bun:**
    ```bash
    bun install
    ```

3.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    *   Create a `.env` file in the root of the project by copying `.env.example`.
        ```
        # Supabase
        VITE_SUPABASE_URL="YOUR_SUPABASE_URL"
        VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY"
        ```
    *   Populate your `.env` file with your Supabase project URL and Anon Key. You can find these in your Supabase project settings.

4.  **Supabase Setup:**

    This project uses Supabase for its backend. You will need to configure your Supabase project with the necessary schema and storage buckets.
       **Copy the SQL Content:**

      **Run in Supabase Dashboard SQL Editor:**
        *   Go to your Supabase project dashboard (supabase.com).
        *   Navigate to **SQL Editor** in the left sidebar.
        *   Paste the entire copied SQL content into the editor.
        *   Click **"Run"** (or the equivalent button) to execute the queries.
        *   This will create all the tables, functions, policies, and other database objects defined in that file in your remote Supabase project's database.




6.  **Run the development server:**
 
	 The application should now be running on `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is busy).

	 ```bash
	 bun run dev
	 ```

## üé® Theming System

Synapse features an extensive theming system managed by `ThemeContext` and defined in `src/index.css`.
*   **Multiple Pre-defined Themes:** Includes a variety of dark (Cyberpunk, Midnight Ash, etc.) and light (Light, Morning Haze, etc.) themes.
*   **Custom Theme Creator:** Users can define their own primary, secondary, and accent colors.
*   **Dynamic Styling:** CSS variables are used extensively, allowing the entire UI to adapt. Theme-specific gradients are generated for major layout components like the sidebar, modals, and backgrounds.
*   **Persistence:** Selected theme and custom colors are saved to `localStorage`.
